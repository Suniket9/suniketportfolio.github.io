    <p>Hello, I’m Suniket Pradhan, a recent graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) from Guru Nanak Institute of Technology. My passion lies in combining technology with creativity to solve real-world challenges. Over the years, I’ve developed a deep interest in signal processing, automation, and front-end web development, areas where I continue to explore and grow.
    During my academic journey, I’ve always been curious about how technology can make a meaningful difference. I have worked on several impactful projects, such as developing ECG signal processing systems for cardiac disease detection and creating visually appealing and functional websites using HTML and CSS. With every project, I aim to learn something new and push the boundaries of innovation.
    <br>
    <b>Academic Background:</b>
    <br>
    I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering with an 80% CGPA from Guru Nanak Institute of Technology. My coursework provided me with a solid foundation in both hardware and software technologies, covering a wide range of subjects from digital image processing to machine learning and embedded systems.
    In addition to my academic studies, I was actively involved in research. This led to the publication of several research papers, primarily focused on digital image processing. My research contributions earned me the JIS Puraskar Award for publishing the highest number of papers during the 2022-2023 academic year.
    <br>
    <b>Technical Skills</b>
    <br>
    Throughout my education and professional journey, I have developed strong technical skills that allow me to tackle various challenges effectively. Some of the key areas I excel in include:
