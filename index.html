            <p id="para">I’m an enthusiastic <b>Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE)</b> graduate from <b>Guru Nanak Institute of Technology</b>, where I completed my <i>B.Tech</i> with <i>80% CGPA</i>. I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, whether it's through signal processing, automation, or web development.
                With a solid foundation in electronics, I’ve explored diverse fields ranging from <b>machine learning</b> applications in healthcare to front-end web development. My academic journey has not only equipped me with technical expertise but also fostered my passion for innovation and continuous learning. I aim to apply my knowledge in dynamic environments and take on challenging projects that drive impact.
                Alongside my engineering studies, I’ve dedicated time to exploring data science and building skills in web technologies like <b>HTML and CSS</b>. With a growing interest in front-end development, I’m continually refining my skills through personal projects like cloning popular websites. I believe in the importance of building intuitive and accessible web interfaces that enhance user experiences.
                I’m also passionate about research and have authored several papers, which earned me the prestigious JIS Puraskar Award for the highest number of published research papers during my academic year. I’m always seeking to expand my knowledge and collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
